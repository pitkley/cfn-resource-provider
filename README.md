# cfn-resource-provider

This library is a relatively thin wrapper enabling the use of Rust in AWS Lambda to provide an
AWS CloudFormation [custom resource]. It is intended to be used in conjunction with
[`rust-aws-lambda`][rust-aws-lambda], a library that enables to run Rust applications serverless
on AWS Lambda using the Go 1.x runtime.

[custom resource]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-custom-resources.html
[rust-aws-lambda]: https://github.com/srijs/rust-aws-lambda

## Quick start example

```rust
use cfn_resource_provider::*;

fn main() {
    aws_lambda::start(cfn_resource_provider::process(|event: CfnRequest<MyResourceProperties>| {
        // Perform the necessary steps to create the custom resource. Afterwards you can return
        // some data that should be serialized into the response. If you don't want to serialize
        // any data, you can return `None` (where you unfortunately have to specify the unknown
        // serializable type using the turbofish).
        Ok(None::<()>)
    }));
}
```
